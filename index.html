                <h2>0. What is a model</h2>
                <p>Models can be thought of as many things. As a system of equations that takes an input and outputs a result. As a map. As a story.</p>
                <p>We live only in the here and now, but models allow us, in a certain sense and for a limited number of issues, to be everywhere and everytime.</p>
                <p>This is why we use models to predict what would happen, to measure the consequences of our decisions. We also use models to diagnose what went wrong.</p>
                <p>There are brilliantly elegant models that rest on flawed assumptions of the real world. There are models that ask the wrong questions.</p>
                <p>This is why a model is not a role-model and building it is in fact the first cybernetic act.</p>

                <h2>1. The need for an organization</h2>
                <h3>Opportunity acquisition</h3>
                <p>Agents can share common goals. An organization offers its members the means to identify
                    opportunities.</p>
                <p>For this experiment the agents (the red dots) have been modeled as pseudo-<em>random walkers</em>
                    <span class="read-more"><span class="read-more-open"></span><span
                            class="read-more-details display-none"><span>The <em>random walk</em> is a process through which a
                            mathematical space is traversed iteratively from the starting point, moving in each
                            iteration with one unit on a particular dimension. This algorithm can be used to simulate
                            brownian motion, the movement of amoebas on a surface, to trace a foraging animal or even to
                            map stock prices.</span> <span> It this case the agents don't start at the origin point of the space and
                            can move simultaneously on the X and Y direction.</span>
                        </span></span> in pursuit of a destination (the green dot). Each agent only has a limited range
                    of acquisition represented by the pulsing
                    red circle. It will identify the opportunity only if it finds it in its range.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The actors are placed on grid with a random offset. The goal is randomly placed.</p>
                <p>The model doesn't necessarily look like what it models. You can think of this simulation in as literal a way as possible: an entity, be it an amoeba, a grazing cow, a drunk man or a submarine, searching for something in low visibility conditions. But this can simulate any kind of searching where the domain is not organized in any way: looking for an arbitrary turn of phrase in a book of poems or finding the differences between nearly matching photos. In these cases the pixels would represent the words, respectively where the eye is falling on the images.</p>
                <p>The agents in the first canvas (<em>Fig. 1a</em>) are pursuing the goal on their own. When
                    reaching the destination they will simply stop. The same space is covered multiple times over. It can take a long time for all of them to reach their goal.

                            <p>You can retry the experiment. There is even a slight possibility that all the independent actors in the first canvas will reach their destination before any in the second one.</p>

                            <p>Play with the parameters for the agents on each canvas. Notice how much fitter (faster and/or with a larger search radius) the agents exploring on their own have to be to reach the goal in a comparable time with those able to collaborate. Also note that the more collaborating agents there are, the quicker they all reach the destination.</p>
                            
                            <p>Fundamental to this result are <strong>lines of communication</strong>, a <strong>shared goal</strong> and a
                                <strong>command structure</strong>.
                            </p>
                            <p>In this case the lines of communication have been presumed to have perfect integrity and
                                considerable speed. </p>
                            <p>It's self-evident that the goal is shared.</p>
                            <p>The command structure is perfectly horizontal. Each member can command each other the full
                                spectrum of possible tasks, which consists of one single command.</p>
                            <p>This is a naive organizational model which we'll complicate later on.</p>
