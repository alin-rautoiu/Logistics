                <h2>0. What is a model</h2>
                <p>Models can be thought of as many things. As a system of equations that takes an input and outputs a
                    result. As a map. As a story.</p>
                <p>We live only in the here and now, but models allow us, in a certain sense and for a limited number of
                    issues, to be everywhere and everytime.</p>
                <p>This is why we use models to predict what would happen, to measure the consequences of our decisions.
                    We also use models to diagnose what went wrong.</p>
                <p>There are brilliantly elegant models that rest on flawed assumptions of the real world. There are
                    models that ask the wrong questions.</p>
                <p>This is why a model is not a role-model and building it is in fact the first cybernetic act.</p>

                <h2>1. The need for an organization</h2>
                <h3>Opportunity acquisition</h3>
                <p>Agents can share common goals. An organization offers its members the means to identify
                    opportunities.</p>
                <p>For this experiment the agents (the red dots) have been modeled as pseudo-<em>random walkers</em>
                    <span class="read-more"><span class="read-more-open"></span><span
                            class="read-more-details display-none"><span>The <em>random walk</em> is a process through
                                which a
                                mathematical space is traversed iteratively from the starting point, moving in each
                                iteration with one unit on a particular dimension. This algorithm can be used to
                                simulate
                                brownian motion, the movement of amoebas on a surface, to trace a foraging animal or
                                even to
                                map stock prices.</span> <span> It this case the agents don't start at the origin point
                                of the space and
                                can move simultaneously on the X and Y direction.</span>
                        </span></span> in pursuit of a destination (the green dot). Each agent only has a limited range
                    of acquisition represented by the pulsing
                    red circle. It will identify the opportunity only if it finds it in its range.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The actors are placed on grid with a random offset. The goal is randomly placed.</p>
                <p>The model doesn't necessarily looks like what it models. You can think of this simulation in as
                    literal a way as possible: an entity, be it an amoeba, a grazing cow, a drunk man or a submarine,
                    searching for something in low visibility conditions. But this can simulate any kind of searching
                    over an unstructured domain: looking for an arbitrary turn of phrase in a book of
                    poems or finding the differences between nearly matching photos. In these cases the pixels would
                    represent the words, respectively where the eye is falling on the images.</p>
                <p>The agents in the first canvas (<em>Fig. 1a</em>) are pursuing the goal on their own. When
                    reaching the destination they will simply stop. The same space is covered multiple times over. It
                    can take a long time for all of them to reach their goal.

                            <p>Play with the parameters for the agents on each canvas. Notice how much fitter (faster
                                and/or with a larger search radius) the agents exploring on their own have to be to
                                reach the goal in a comparable time with those able to collaborate. Also note that the
                                more collaborating agents there are, the quicker they all reach the destination.</p>

                            <p>Fundamental to this result are <strong>lines of communication</strong>, a <strong>shared
                                    goal</strong> and a
                                <strong>command structure</strong>.

                            <p>In this case the lines of communication have been presumed to have perfect integrity and
                                considerable speed. </p>
                            <p>It's self-evident that the goal is shared.</p>
                            <p>The command structure is perfectly horizontal. Each member can issue to each other the
                                full spectrum of possible tasks, which in this case consists of one single command.</p>
                            <p>This is a naive organizational model that we'll complicate later on.</p>

                    period of time, they expire. As before, we can think of this from the literal and prosaic, such as
                    animals dying from lack of food, to the more complex, such as employees quitting a job if they don't
                    find the tasks they're given stimulating enough. </p>
